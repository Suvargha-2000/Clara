Here I will write what my voice assistant is capable of to keep track of it -

1.Tell good morning with weather forecast using 'Openweather Api' with the song 'Back in Black - AC/DC'.
2.Open Email(Gmail)
3.Open Facebook
4.open web whatsapp
5.Can open any windows appplication
6.Ai added to the assistant(currently the database is so small that it may cause some error in prediction
over fitting may happen)
7.The output and commands are if/else controlled never found a way to apply AI for commands
8.Can be used with arduino giving correct serial output
9.speech recognition with the app
